The website Uneek is an open source project, and the
code\footnote{https://github.com/PerMalm/uneek} is available under MIT.
The tool handles xml and text input. When given raw text, a simple whitespace
tokenizer is run. When working with xml, all text nodes are considered as well
as all attributes of all tags. The only assumption made is for the shallow
syntax function, where the xml tag \verb|sentence| is considered to give
the span wherein the syntax chains are constructed.
